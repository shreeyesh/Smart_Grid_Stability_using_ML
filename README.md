# Smart Grid Stability
<p>Machine learning - Deep learning - Smart grid stability</p>
<p>This repository contains datasets, python code (.ipynb Jupyter notebook) used to predict smart grid stability with deep learning.</p>
At the end we were able to predict with an accuracy of 99.42% using deep learning models.
<p>Much further Explainantion is done it jupyter notebook.</p>
Feel free to star and fork this repo.
